poverty_14,Population living below the poverty line,Poverty headcount ratio at national poverty lines (% of population),World Bank,https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.NAHC,National poverty headcount ratio is the percentage of the population living below the national poverty lines. National estimates are based on population-weighted subgroup estimates from household surveys.,"Poverty headcount ratio among the population is measured based on national (i.e. country-specific) poverty lines. A country may have a unique national poverty line or separate poverty lines for rural and urban areas, or for different geographic areas to reflect differences in the cost of living or sometimes to reflect differences in diets and consumption baskets. Poverty estimates at national poverty lines are computed from household survey data collected from nationally representative samples of households.","This series only includes estimates that to the best of our [the World Bank's] knowledge are reasonably comparable over time for a country. Due to differences in estimation methodologies and poverty lines, estimates should not be compared across countries.",155 countries,Most recent data available between 1985 and 2019.,Annual,Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International license,https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by,Poverty Headcount Ratio at National Poverty Lines (% of Population).

Climate_risks,Climate Risk Index Score,The Long-Term Climate Risk Index (CRI): from 2000 to 2019 (annual averages),Germanwatch,https://germanwatch.org/en/cri,Level of exposure and vulnerability to more frequent and/or more severe climatic events for which countries should prepare.,"Indicates a level of exposure and vulnerability to more frequent and/or more severe climatic events for which countries should prepare. It analyses to what extent countries have been affected by the impacts of weather-related loss events (storms, floods, heat waves etc.). The most recent data available from 2019 and 2000-2019 were taken into account. Developed by Germanwatch analyses the quantified impacts both in terms of fatalities as well as economic losses that occurred based on data from the Munich RE NatCatSERVICE.","The index must not be mistaken for a comprehensive climate vulnerability scoring. It represents one important piece in the overall puzzle of climate related impacts and the associated vulnerabilities. The index focuses on extreme weather events such as storms, floods and heatwaves but does not take into account important slow-onset processes such as rising sea levels, glacier melting or ocean warming and acidification. It is based on past data and should not be used as a basis for a linear projection of future climate impacts. More specifically, not too far-reaching conclusions should be drawn for the purpose of political discussions regarding which country or region is the most vulnerable to climate change. Also, it is important to note that the occurrence of a single extreme event cannot be easily attributed to anthropogenic climate change. In addition, contrary to previous years, the underlying database for the calculation of the 2021 data does not include data for the United States of America.",180 countries,The most recent data available from 2019 and 2000-2019,Annual.
