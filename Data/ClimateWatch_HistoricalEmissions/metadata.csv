The scenario in which country-reported data (CRF, BUR, UNFCCC) is prioritized over third-party data (CDIAC, FAO, Andrew, EDGAR, BP) is used on Climate Watch. The data resolves the main IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) 2006 categories. Subsector data for Energy, Industrial Processes, Agriculture and Waste is available for CO2, CH4, and N2O. Due to data availability and methodological issues, PRIMAP-hist dataset does not include emissions from land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF). Non-CO2 emissions are expressed in CO2 equivalents using 100-year global warming potential values from IPCC Fourth Assessment Report.","Multiple scenarios are published by PIK.

Thus the present version 2.5 includes data for 2022. For energy CO2 growth rates from the BP statistical review of world energy are used to extend the country reported (CR) or CDIAC (TP) data to 2022. For CO2 from cement production Andrew cement data are used.
